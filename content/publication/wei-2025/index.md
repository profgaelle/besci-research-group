abstract: "The sources of teacher stress in the socio-politico context of China have been understudied. Objective This paper details the development and validation of the Chinese teacher sources of stress (CT-SOS) scale, which considers multiple social-ecological aspects. Methods The psychometric properties of the CT-SOS scale have been tested using three samples involving a total of 598 Chinese schoolteachers. Results Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrate the multi-dimensional structure of the scale and its discriminant validity. Conclusion The usefulness of this reliable and valid scale is discussed considering the context of ongoing education reforms and the impact of the COVID-19 on schoolteachers in China."
