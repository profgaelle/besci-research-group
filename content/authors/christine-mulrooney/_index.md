I am a postgraduate student at Kingston Business School, currently undertaking an MSc in Occupational & Business Psychology. My academic work focuses on employee wellbeing and the psychological factors that shape how individuals experience and navigate work.

Building on my undergraduate dissertation exploring the relationship between sleep and workplace conflict across home-based, hybrid and in-person work settings, I continued to develop a deep interest in the role that personal experiences play in shaping our approaches to wellbeing, both professionally and personally.

This summer, I volunteered as a research assistant on a project developing a low-intensity wellbeing intervention for neurodivergent individuals. As part of this work, I helped design research materials and ran focus groups exploring sleep perspectives among neurodivergent young adults.
I am passionate about creating inclusive, evidence-based approaches to wellbeing that account for the diversity of human experience.
