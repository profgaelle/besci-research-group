I am an Msc Occupational and Business Psychology student at Kingston University. I hold an MSc in Clinical Psychology, where in my dissertation I investigated the relationship  between impostor syndrome and work efficiency by exploring the moderating role of social support among IT employees. Through this project, I developed a deep interest in employee and organisational well-being. 

My research interests include organisational behaviour, decision-making, motivation, and workplace wellbeing. I have published my dissertation in the International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research and previously worked as a Research Assistant at India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), where I conducted qualitative research.

I am focused on developing strong applied research skills and contributing to evidence-based behavioural and organisational psychology by informing real-world interventions and decision-making.
