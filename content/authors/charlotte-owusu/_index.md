I am an MSc in Occupational and Business Psychology student at Kingston Business School. I completed my BSc in Psychology at Edge Hill University, where I first developed an
interest in the application of psychology in the workplace. I have worked as a research assistant for projects on social identity and synchronisation using virtual reality (VR). My undergraduate dissertation explored the perception of trustworthiness in different accents. I foumd this interesting and felt it could be applied to research in the 
workplace. My research interests include organisational identity, organisational change and how this affects creativity, innovation and pro-social behaviours in the 
workplace. I have experience working in research and administration, while also taking part in volunteering and fundraising initiatives.
