I am Professor of Behavioural Science at Kingston Business School, where I led research and enterprise strategy (2019–2025) and served as Town House Fellow (2023–2024). I am a member of the Behaviour, Business and Policy Institute at Kingston University and I lead the BeSCi research group, exploring behavioural insights, decision-making, and creative cognition.

My research investigates how people make decisions, solve problems, and regulate motivation—especially in creative, organisational, sustainability, and healthcare contexts. I’ve published over 60 peer-reviewed articles and received funding from the Wellcome Trust, Leverhulme Trust, Sanofi-Pasteur, and others.

I’ve served as President of the European Association for Decision Making and contribute as Associate Editor for the European Review of Applied Psychology and currently serving as guest editor for AI & Society. My work has been featured in The New York Times, BMJ, France Inter, and LSE Business Review, and I regularly consult for organisations including  PromoVeritas, Quadrangle, and Sanofi-Pasteur.
